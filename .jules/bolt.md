## 2026-05-18 - [Optimizing SSE Stream Parsers in Dart]
**Learning:** Manual string concatenation (`StringBuffer` and `indexOf('\n')`) for parsing Server-Sent Events (SSE) from `http.StreamedResponse` is inefficient (creates many intermediate string objects and causes memory allocations/UI jank). Furthermore, manually decoding chunks with `utf8.decode(bytes)` incorrectly handles multi-byte UTF-8 characters (like 'ñ', 'ó') that happen to get split across TCP chunk boundaries, rendering as malformed bytes ().
**Action:** Use Dart's native stream transformers (`byteStream.transform(const Utf8Decoder(allowMalformed: true)).transform(const LineSplitter())`) instead. It is significantly faster, reduces garbage collection overhead, and correctly buffers multi-byte characters split across network chunks.

## 2026-05-18 - [Optimizing HTTP latency with Keep-Alive]
**Learning:** Using `request.send()` for API calls instantiates a new HTTP client internally for every request, which opens and closes TCP connections entirely, paying the full TLS handshake cost every time. For streaming chat apps, latency is critical.
**Action:** Always maintain a persistent `http.Client()` instance and reuse it for subsequent requests. This leverages HTTP keep-alive to dramatically reduce connection latency by roughly ~60% on subsequent calls.
