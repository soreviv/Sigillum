## 2026-05-18 - [Optimizing SSE Stream Parsers in Dart]
**Learning:** Manual string concatenation (`StringBuffer` and `indexOf('\n')`) for parsing Server-Sent Events (SSE) from `http.StreamedResponse` is inefficient (creates many intermediate string objects and causes memory allocations/UI jank). Furthermore, manually decoding chunks with `utf8.decode(bytes)` incorrectly handles multi-byte UTF-8 characters (like 'ñ', 'ó') that happen to get split across TCP chunk boundaries, rendering as malformed bytes ().
**Action:** Use Dart's native stream transformers (`byteStream.transform(const Utf8Decoder(allowMalformed: true)).transform(const LineSplitter())`) instead. It is significantly faster, reduces garbage collection overhead, and correctly buffers multi-byte characters split across network chunks.

## 2026-05-28 - [Flutter Stream Rendering Optimization]
**Learning:** Rebuilding a whole `Scaffold`/`ListView` on every chunk of an SSE text stream via `setState()` causes major UI jank and excessive frame rendering, especially since chat streams can have hundreds of chunks per message.
**Action:** Use `ValueNotifier<String>` along with a targeted `ValueListenableBuilder` to surgically rebuild *only* the single `ChatBubble` widget that displays the streaming text, drastically reducing the size of the render tree that needs updating on every network chunk.
